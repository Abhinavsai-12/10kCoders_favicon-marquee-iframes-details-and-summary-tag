        <summary>Kaju Pulao</summary>
        Cashew Pulao is the simplest, yet flavorful pulaos that you can ever think of. 
        It is also like being fancy with a rice dish, but not fancy too. Nice long fragrant basmati rice, 
        onions, ginger-garlic paste, cashews and some whole spices in a pressure cooker and voila! 
        A thing of beauty is done in just 2 to 3 whistles.
       The flavor of the cashews coming through in this pulao makes every bite of this Kaju Pulao heavenly. 
       If you want to use the readymade ginger-garlic paste instead of making at home, do that. 
       Want to make this no-fuss pulao in a pot or pan and not the pressure cooker? Go ahead with it.

        <summary>Chicken Biriyani</summary>
        Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish including layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. 
        The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. 
        Buried in the Biryani, you'll find whole cuts of succulent chicken bursting with flavor from the potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics it's marinated in
